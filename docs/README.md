# Goal of the Package

The repository contains scripts to generate simulations of pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (pNMR) free induction decay (FID) signals.

## Installation & Requirements

This package is a pure python package and does not yet need a full installation. Just make sure you have installed the dependencies listed below and all scripts from this repository in a single folder.

The package could be installed using `pip`.

The package is based on
* numpy
* scipy
* numericalunits (<= numericalunits-1.23 if used with python2)
* matplotlib (for plotting)
* time, copy, json (from standard modules)
* ROOT (optional in one analysis mode)
