* Coil -> implement multi layer coil
          Dimensions in Ran's "MUON G-2 NMR FREQUENCY EXTRACTION" Sec. 5.3 Table 1
* EMF ->  see Ran's "MUON G-2 NMR FREQUENCY EXTRACTION" Sec. 5.1 Eq. 36:
          potential energy U = - current * Phi_muC
          Phi_muC = vec(mu) dot_product vec(B_coil) / current

          --> units
            mu = A mÂ²
            B = T
            current = A
            --> U = J or eV
            That corresponds for electrons with charge e a voltage in V.
